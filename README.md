# Polarized

A simple polarized type system for computational propositional logic, following the model of Downen & Ariola's [Duality in Action](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol195-fscd2021/LIPIcs.FSCD.2021.1/LIPIcs.FSCD.2021.1.pdf). I've defined a focusing proof search for it. 

# To Do

* Quantifiers - left them out so far but should be easy to add now that I have a clear idea of focusing.
* Evaluation - rather fiddly.
* Improve error messages.

# Future Work

* defining a parser so I can write this normally. Or weirdly, even.
* ???
